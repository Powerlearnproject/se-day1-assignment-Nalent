#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The development of programming languages.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. 
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface. 
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. 
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements. 
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers. 
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology
Sequential Process: Linear, phase-by-phase approach; one phase must finish before the next begins.
Fixed Requirements: Works best when requirements are clear and unlikely to change.
Documentation-Heavy: Focuses on extensive documentation for each phase.
Use When:

Requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
The project is simple or in regulated industries like healthcare.
Example: Developing a payroll system with fixed specifications.

Agile Methodology
Iterative Process: Development occurs in short cycles (sprints), allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
Flexible Requirements: Suited for projects where requirements may evolve.
Customer-Centric: Involves continuous collaboration and feedback from customers.
Use When:

Requirements are uncertain or expected to change.
The project is complex and needs regular customer feedback.
Example: Developing a mobile app with frequent updates based on user feedback.

Key Differences
Flexibility: Waterfall is rigid; Agile is adaptable.
Documentation: Waterfall is documentation-heavy; Agile prioritizes working software.
Customer Involvement: Waterfall has limited interaction; Agile involves ongoing collaboration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

They enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.

Examples of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
Examples of Version Control Systems (VCS): Git, Subversion, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines and Technical Debt.
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. It ensures the reliability of each part, catching bugs early in development, which reduces the cost and effort needed to fix issues later. 
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. It verifies that these components work together correctly, identifying issues in the integration points that could cause failures in the system. 
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. It validates that the integrated software meets all specified requirements, ensuring the overall functionality and performance of the system. 
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This final testing phase confirms that the software is ready for deployment by verifying that it fulfills user expectations and business goals.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt:
"Can you tell me about animals?"

Improved prompt:
"Can you tell me why lions have big manes and live in Africa?"

Explanation:
The improved prompt is better because it:

Focuses on a Specific Animal: Instead of asking about all animals, it asks about lions.
Asks for a Specific Detail: It inquires about the lion's mane and where it lives, making it easier to answer with clear information.
Is Easier to Understand: It's straightforward and directs the answer to a particular point.
